# Helpers

Common, reusable chunks of functionality meant to be used throughout the app. Should be kept smaller and simpler whenever possible, if more complex abstraction is needed then it should be brought into the presenters.

Easy to use it in other classes with a line like this: `include CategoriesHelper`
