> Type is a beautiful group of letters, not a group of beautiful letters.

* Focus on type as **groups of blocks**
* Keep it aligned! Align it until it feels right (it's not an exact science)
* Start with one typeface with **at least four different contrast weights.** High contrast makes it easier to separate different headers and body text
* For contrasting font sizes - when in doubt, make larger type groups **twice as large**
* Don't forget line spacing, or `line-height`. When in doubt, use a line-height between **1.2x (short paragraphs) and 1.5x (long paragraphs)**
* Don't let the width get too wide. Aim for **40-70 characters per line**
